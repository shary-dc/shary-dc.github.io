about_content: | 
  Full-stack developer and data engineering specialist with extensive experience building solutions across web, API, and data environments. My toolkit includes .NET/C#, Angular, SQL, Python, and the Microsoft BI stack (SSRS, SSIS, SSAS), enabling me to create seamless data pipelines and high-impact reports. I’ve led a team of 25+ developers, I have modernized legacy projects, architected several data, web and console applications, and designed CI/CD pipelines that elevate code quality and deployment speed. Recently, I’ve learned PowerBI, adding new layers of data visualization and automation to my skillset.
